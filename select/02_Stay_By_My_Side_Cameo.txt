Somethings people just cant see
And of all the things that are real
They pretend they dont exist

(I had to forget my pride)

And let my destination ride
And i founded something there

(And please dont let people fool you
Your women love got to be the closet
The closet thing to your)

I met many of women in my days
And theres one thing they all had to say
Since you came into my life
Everything has been so nice
Yea hey yea um um um

(Stay here with me by my side)

Cause if i lose your love im sure to have lost
Umm everything

(You have always been my guide)

And with no further do... im thinking you
For being here

How can you say that you been her man

(When you really dont understand)

Just what - shes all about

(Stand strong and amitted when your wrong)

You have nothing to lose and all to gain
You know you needed her

(And please dont let people mislead you
If they understood the situation
Their life would be much sweeter)

Though all my friends look at me and said
They say how could you let a women make you feel this way
But if they only knew the joy it is
Their life will be alot sweeter too.
Baby baby baby yea

(Stay here with me by my side)

If i lose your love im sure to have lost emm everything

(You have always been my guide)

You always been my guide baby
And with no further do
Im gonna thank you
I wanna thank you
Baby- im thanking you
Yea o yea-----

(Stay here with me by my side)

Yea if i lose your love im sure to have lost emm everything
