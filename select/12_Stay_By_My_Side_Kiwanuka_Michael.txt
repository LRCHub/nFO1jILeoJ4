You owe me no
Apologies
For all we know
We've never seen
No heart's designed
To be alone
But yours and mine
Overflow

In rolling tides
You're hoping that I won't leave the shore
Stay by my side
There's nothing that I would leave you for
Stay by my side

Things fall apart
It always seems
To haunt your heart
With vacant dreams
You're holding on
Way too tight
Don't fortify
Wasted time

In rolling tides
You're hoping that I won't leave the shore
Stay by my side
There's nothing that I would leave you for

In rolling tides
You're hoping that I won't leave the shore
Stay by my side
There's nothing that I would leave you for
Stay by my side
