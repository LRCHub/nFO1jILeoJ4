You say,I'm the only one You need
And I know, If you leave, my heart will bleed
Tell me that our love's just begun
And stay by my side,forever
one day,we shall belong to the past
Like a dream,our lives go by so fast
Promise me you'll never forget me
And stay by my side
I don't want to live my life without you
I feel free and we have nothing to hide
To night it's so hard to breathe without you
Oh baby tell me you'll stay by my side
You say,you want to drown in my eyes
With you,I'm a shining star in the sky
Tell me that our love is endless
And stay by my side
Oh baby stay by my side
